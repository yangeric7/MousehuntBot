# MousehuntBot

MousehuntBot is a basic bot that sounds the horn for you! It can log in given the login page, sound the horn every 15 to 20 minutes 
in order to avoid basic bot detection.

I used this as practice to understand the basics of the Selenium Web Driver.

I hope to also create functionality to answer the Kings Reward which is a captcha image to deter bots. I hope to use
an image recognition library such as Tesseract-OCR.
